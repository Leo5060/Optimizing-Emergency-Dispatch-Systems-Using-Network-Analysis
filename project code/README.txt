# Emergency Dispatch Optimization using CPM & Crashing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies **Critical Path Method (CPM) and Crashing** to optimize emergency dispatch operations, reducing response delays.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `dispatch_optimization.py` â†’ Python script for scheduling optimization.
- `README.txt` â†’ Instructions for running the script.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset (Kaggle)
- Dataset Name: **Emergency Response Time Dataset**
- Download Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Save the dataset as `emergency_dispatch_data.csv` in the same folder as the script.

## ðŸš€ Running the Code
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy networkx matplotlib ortools
   ```
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python dispatch_optimization.py
   ```

## âœ… Expected Output
- Critical Path visualization for emergency dispatch.
- Optimized dispatch times using **Google OR-Tools**.
